    <h1>Project Team UG4: Financial Markets During COVID, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Aranjin Enkhbat</strong>, <strong>Bisrat Kassie</strong>, <strong>Angela Liu</strong>, <strong>Helen Lin</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>With this visualization, we want to show how the stock market changes over time and how the specific time frame we’re looking at (the start of the pandemic) compares to previous and future market values.
       The visualization provides a lot of information in each line/candlestick, giving the user the open and close of a day, and the low and high with the centered lines to each candlestick.
       The colors are once again reflective of the common thought that red refers to negative values and green to positive values.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Here are some of the questions we are looking to answer with the visualization: </em></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><em>How did the COVID-19 Pandemic affect financial markets?</em></li>
      <li><em>Which industries suffered the most?</em></li>
      <li><em>Which industries saw the most growth?</em></li>
      <li><em>How did government interventions and other developments affect the markets?</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Here are the descriptions for the datasets in our drop down menu: </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>BTC: Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It is a form of currency with no goverment oversight. </em></li>
      <li><em>DJI: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, is a stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the 
        United States and includes most sectors and industries. </em></li>
      <li><em>HGX: Housing Sector Index tracks housing development companies working directly in the U.S. construction market</em></li>
      <li><em>IXIC: Nasdaq Composite is a stock market index that includes almost all stocks 
      listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange (more than 2500 stocks). It is one of the three most-followed stock market indices 
      in the United States. The composition of the NASDAQ Composite is heavily weighted towards companies in the information technology sector.</em></li>
      <li><em>QQQ: Invesco QQQ ETF tracks the Nasdaq-100® Index — giving you access to the performance of the 100 largest 
      non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq.</em></li>
      <li><em>SPX: The Standard and Poor's 500, is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the 
      largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. </em></li>
      <li><em>VIX: Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index, is a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>To summarize, our visualization features an interactive candlestick chart representing daily, weekly, or monthly stock data (low, high, open, close) for a selected stock from a dropdown menu. The candlestick's two strokes will indicate the highest and lowest values, turning red for negative and green for positive changes, with additional details accessible upon hovering over a candlestick. 
    </em></p>
    <p><em>Additionally, the interface presents two candlestick charts for daily and weekly datasets. The first chart encompasses all data points from the table, offering a comprehensive overview. However, its density of information can make it difficult to examine specific time periods in detail. To address this, the second chart provides a focused view of the area selected (brushed) in the first chart, showcasing only the highlighted data points. This dual chart approach grants users the flexibility to seamlessly navigate the dataset, enabling in-depth exploration of chosen intervals with greater clarity and detail.
    </em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>We have gathered BTC-USD, DJI, HGX, IXIC, QQQ, SPX, and VPX daily/weekly/monthly datasets from MarketWatch. The data is pulled in a CSV format and to process, we have written a script that converts it to JSON to be easily parsable and accessible within our code.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>In order to make the data accessible and digestable, we have decided to incorporate interactivities such as allowing the dataset to be changed for comparison; all dataset to be viewed in 3 different options (daily/weekly/monthly); brushing and linking across visualizations; and allowing details on demand (upon hovering over a candlestick).</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>We wanted to prioritize “gauging the impact of government interventions across sectors” and “comparing market reactions to initial outbreak vs reactions to new variants”. This visualization design is a great way to show how the stock market changes over time and how the specific time frame we’re looking at compares to previous and future market values. <br><br>
      
      In addition, our goal was to enhance our visualization with detailed insights incorporating open, close, high, and low values for each data point while also introducing a mechanism to indicate whether there was a positive or negative change. This design choice ensures a comprehensive data representation within each candlestick. The candlestick's upper and lower wicks represent the highest and lowest values respectively. Interactive elements are integrated, as hovering over a candlestick reveals the opening and closing values. And the color scheme employs red to denote negative values and green for positive values enhancing the intuitive understanding of the data presented.
    </em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Our project was successful in achieving its initial goal to illustrate the fluctuations in the stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic through interactive and intuitive visualizations. However, while working on aspects of the visualizations, particularly the interactive candlestick chart, we realized the broader use: allowing users to explore stock market data across different sectors and timeframes, in a digestible format.

      The greatest accomplishments of our visualization was making complex financial data accessible and understandable, making finance accessible and engaging for a broad audience. The interactive elements of the visualization, such as the ability to switch between datasets, view data in different time intervals, and access detailed information on demand, coupled by the friendly UI allowed for a easier development of understanding of the stock market.
      
      
    <p><em>  While the project was successful in many aspects, there are opportunities for further improvement and exploration. Future work could focus on expanding the dataset to include more industries or global markets for a more comprehensive analysis. Incorporating more advanced financial performance indicators could make this visualization more insightful to an audience who do have a financial background. 
    <p><em>Lastly, our team would like to thank Professor Dylan Cashman and TAs Derrick Kim and Ziao Yang for faciliating our work on such a rewarding final project.
