    <h1>Project Team UG4: Financial Markets During COVID, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Aranjin Enkhbat</strong>, <strong>Bisrat Kassie</strong>, <strong>Angela Liu</strong>, <strong>Helen Lin</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>With this visualization, we want to show how the stock market changes over time and how the specific time frame we’re looking at (the start of the pandemic) compares to previous and future market values.
       The visualization provides a lot of information in each line/candlestick, giving the user the open and close of a day, and the low and high with the centered lines to each candlestick.
       The colors are once again reflective of the common thought that red refers to negative values and green to positive values.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Here are some of the questions we are looking to answer with the visualization: </em></p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><em>How did the COVID-19 Pandemic affect financial markets?</em></li>
      <li><em>Which industries suffered the most?</em></li>
      <li><em>Which industries saw the most growth?</em></li>
      <li><em>How did government interventions and other developments affect the markets?</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Here descriptions for the datasets in our drop down menu: </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>BTC: Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. It is a form of currency with no goverment oversight. </em></li>
      <li><em>DJI: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, is a stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the 
        United States and includes most sectors and industries. </em></li>
      <li><em>HGX: Housing Sector Index tracks housing development companies working directly in the U.S. construction market</em></li>
      <li><em>IXIC: Nasdaq Composite is a stock market index that includes almost all stocks 
      listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange (more than 2500 stocks). It is one of the three most-followed stock market indices 
      in the United States. The composition of the NASDAQ Composite is heavily weighted towards companies in the information technology sector.</em></li>
      <li><em>QQQ: Invesco QQQ ETF tracks the Nasdaq-100® Index — giving you access to the performance of the 100 largest 
      non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq.</em></li>
      <li><em>SPX: The Standard and Poor's 500, is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the 
      largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. </em></li>
      <li><em>VIX: Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index, is a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>TO BE FILLED DURING FINAL SPRINT: Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>
    
    <video controls width="100%">

    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>TO BE FILLED DURING FINAL SPRINT: Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>We have gather BTC-USD, DJI, HGX, IXIC, QQQ, SPX, and VPX daily/weekly/monthly datasets from MarketWatch. The data is pulled in a CSV format and to process, we have written a script that converts it to JSON to be easily parsable and accessible within our code.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>In order to make the data accessible and digestable, we have decided to incorporate interactivities such as allowing the dataset to be changed for comparison; all dataset to be viewed in 3 different options; brushing and linking across visualizations; and allowing details on demand (upon hovering over a wick).</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>We wanted to prioritize “gauging the impact of government interventions across sectors” and “comparing market reactions to initial outbreak vs reactions to new variants”. This visualization design is a great way to show how the stock market changes over time and how the specific time frame we’re looking at compares to previous and future market values. <br><br>

      The white vertical lines along with the gray rectangular boxes in the graph show critical events that happened during the pandemic (government interventions like shutdowns and stimulus checks or even times when new variants were discovered). This way, users will be able to correlate any significant movements in the stock market to any of those events.<br><br>
      
      In addition, this visualization has a wealth of information in each candlestick. The two strokes of the candlestick convey the highest and lowest values and when we click on a candlestick we get the opening and closing values. The color scheme employs red to denote negative values and green for positive values enhancing the intuitive understanding of the data presented.<br><br>
      </em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>TO BE FILLED DURING FINAL SPRINT: Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
